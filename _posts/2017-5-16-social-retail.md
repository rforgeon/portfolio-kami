According to 1,000 people from across the country from personal budgeting software company [YouNeedaBudget.com](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/spend-shop-friends-study-article-1.2197726), 63% of people prefer shopping alone.

For the rest of us, we'd rather be with friends...

Modern retail is missing out on the social benefits of a traditional mall.

But how is an old-fashioned, waterhole mall, a better social experience than what we have today?

We are more social than ever; is it impossible for a digital experience to overtake traditional retail?

Both shoppers and retailers love social shopping! What’s innovating social retail?

## Shopper ❤️ Social Shopping

According to [Dresser](http://dressertheapp.com/blog/2016/09/01/do-you-prefer-shopping-alone-or-with-friends/) blog, shopping alone sucks:

- Your Friends Can’t Give You a Second Opinion
- It’s Less Fun Without Company
- You Overlook Items Your Friends Might Pick Out

## Retailers ❤️ Social Shopping

According to the YouNeedaBudget survey, 64% of adults said they end up spending more money when they shop with friends.


This makes me curious about social retail, so I built an app to test social retail behavior with my own form of a digital shopping mall:
