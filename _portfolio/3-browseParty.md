<a href="https://browse-party.herokuapp.com/">Browse Party</a> is a video chatroom that can be added to any website. After a simple signup, a website owner receives access to a dashboard that includes code unique to them. This code can then be copy and pasted into their website where they want the Browse Party tool to appear.
