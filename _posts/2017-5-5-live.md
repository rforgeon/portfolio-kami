I became interested in Live when Meerkat had [their explosive entrance to the world stage](https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SXSW is moot. No one can learn about anything new because every conversation ends up being about Meerkat.</p>&mdash; Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/577273405952544768">March 16, 2015</a></blockquote>

I set up a live squirrel cam on Meerkat that tweeted every time a motion sensor next to the squirrel detected motion. The squirrel‚Äôs stage was a hanging ball of peanut butter.

It was pretty cool, and squirrels came! I could watch them live once they arrived. I started spamming my friends‚Äô emails with the ‚ÄúSQUIRREL IS LIVE‚Äù motion sensor event... however, the sensor started picking up shadows that moved every time the wind picked up.

Notifications kept coming.

I was politely reminded by my friends that they were trying to work and to stop sending them emails.

My second interest in Live occurred when I learned of China‚Äôs live streaming craze. People where live streaming and getting sent digital gifts a.k.a. Cold hard cash in the form of a digital teddy bear sticker. I was pretty intrigued by the trend, although it‚Äôs a bit hard to get past the fact that it‚Äôs a lot of creepy dudes throwing money at girls. Outside of that, there are some great performers, comedians, and personalities.

However, more than watching, Live allows for interaction. Either with motion sensors and squirrels or through digital gifts resulting in the broadcaster‚Äôs reaction.

I loved the interaction piece and I wondered of other ways to interact with Live content.

I added it to augmented reality‚Ä¶.

And I connected it to hardware‚Ä¶

First with [Russell Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellkwilliams/), a brilliant mechanical engineer who makes awesome robots and architects automated systems.

He created a ‚Äútug of war‚Äù light board and I added some chat functionality. While watching the light board on YouTube Live, you could control the lights when sending a command in the live chat.

Going further off this idea, how cool would it be if you were watching a live interview or late night show and you could do something to warrant a reaction from Jimmy Fallon?

What if there was a water balloon above his head during the show and if 1 million people hit a button, that water balloon would pop on Fallon?...

I hired freelancer, [Mitchell B](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018e90fb3314781d22), and he developed a balloon popper. He did an outstanding job and you should definitely hire him if you‚Äôre looking to add some hardware to your projects.

After first building my own simple chat bot, I found a more robust chatbot called [Nightbot](https://beta.nightbot.tv/) and connected my own custom Rails 5 API.

Now when watching the balloon Live on YouTube, you can type !pop in the chat and move the needle towards the balloon. I‚Äôve limited the command to only two !pop commands per viewer, so if you want to pop this balloon, you will need to recruit your friends.

## Next Steps

My next steps will most likely implement mass input art to some degree. I‚Äôm very inspired by [Pixel Place](http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/).

"Each pixel you see was placed by hand. Each icon, each flag, each meme created painstakingly by millions of people who had nothing in common except an Internet connection. Somehow, someway, what happened in Reddit over those 72 hours was the birth of Art." - [sudoscript](http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/)

Although I really like the digital aspect of this, there are definitely some hardware aspects that could be translated here.

If you‚Äôre still wondering - I cried because I‚Äôm passionate about üî¥Live, general technological advancement, and how our interactions morph and compliment these advancements. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes that these amazingly clear astronauts at this very moment were playing ping pong with water...in space...and I was witnessing it. I felt as if I was apart of it! That‚Äôs the power of üî¥Live.
