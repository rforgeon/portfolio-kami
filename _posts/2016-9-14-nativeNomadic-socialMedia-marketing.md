Currently I am focussing my nativeNomadic marketing on Instagram [@nativeNomadic](https://www.instagram.com/nativenomadic/).

With Instagram automation and the breakout of Instagram stories - it is easy to get a lot of work in with minimal effort (maximum automation).

Two tools I want to focus on in this post are used for:
*     **Follow Automation** ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘¬ðŸ‘«
*     **Instagram Story Takeovers** ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘½  

Follow Automation
-------------------
Follow automation is important because when you follow others, they follow you back - this is a powerful dynamic to understand.

Furthermore, you can always then unfollow these users and they will remain your followers.

Lastly, this whole process can be automated with a great tool called [Instagress](https://instagress.com). ðŸ™Œ

Here is a great video on how to set it up:

Instagram Story Takeovers
------------

Instagram story takeovers allow you to provide a ton of value to your followers for a small price.

The cost to me is finding digital nomads who will allow me to repost their stories and photos.

After lining up a few nomads, I use a tool called [Repost & Roll](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/repost-roll-for-instagram/id1142236676?mt=8) that allows me to simply repost another users content to my account.

And âœ¨_voila_âœ¨ a flushed out account with content catered towards those interested in digital nomad culture.

The combination of follow automation and takeover content makes for good growth and reach. ðŸ“ˆ
