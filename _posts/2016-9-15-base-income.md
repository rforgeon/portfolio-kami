My dad always taught me to "make your money work for you."

This refers to the idea of gaining a cashflow while you are not working, rather than work for an hourly wage or salary.

This is a common theme among digital nomads today. Most achieve this outcome by creating a [high traffic blog](http://expertvagabond.com/paid-to-travel-world/) or Saas application.

Outside of having your money work for you, you might be working free lance or on contract with a company.

**_commonly found is a combination of the two_**

Sounds complicated with a lot of floating pieces, right?

**_Your'e right._**

Not only is it difficult to manage separate projects, it is difficult to account for how your income might be effected, or even slightly resemble on a monthly basis.

After all, our world is structured for a month to month balance of income and expenses.

When visiting Sweden, local friends of mine explained that the culture is straight line, vanilla üç¶. Risk is not highly tolerated and you follow in your lane.

If risk is not tolerated, how does Stockholm produces the [highest number of so-called ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù per capita](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-stockholm-became-a-unicorn-factory/), after San Francisco?

Well one idea, amongst great infrastructure, is in the antithesis of cultural risk taking: **stability**.

My friend explained to me -

"Stockholm has so many startups because the guy or gal in their garage knows that if they fail, they will have the support of the government to catch them."

"She doesn't have to rely on a job to provide her healthcare, or education, or basic living essentials."

"So really, the risk of starting something is quite small."

What if this idea could be captured and collectively practiced amongst like-minded individuals?

If a group of people could come together to support one another in achieving a small portion of base income, they would propel one another by distributing risk.

*     _Risk of not having work._

*     _Risk of losing an opportunity to further one's education._

*     _Risk of starting a business._

I've been toying with the idea. More to come üîú
