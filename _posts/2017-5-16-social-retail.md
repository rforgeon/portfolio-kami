According to 1,000 people from across the country from personal budgeting software company [YouNeedaBudget.com](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/spend-shop-friends-study-article-1.2197726), 63% of people prefer shopping alone.

For the rest of us, we'd rather be with friends...

Modern retail is missing out on the social benefits of a traditional mall.

But how is an old-fashioned, waterhole mall, a better social experience than what we have today?

We are more social than ever; is it impossible for a digital experience to overtake traditional retail?

Both shoppers and retailers love social shopping! What’s innovating social retail?

## Shoppers ❤️ Social Shopping

According to [Dresser](http://dressertheapp.com/blog/2016/09/01/do-you-prefer-shopping-alone-or-with-friends/) blog, shopping alone sucks:

- Your Friends Can’t Give You a Second Opinion
- It’s Less Fun Without Company
- You Overlook Items Your Friends Might Pick Out

## Retailers ❤️ Social Shopping

According to the YouNeedaBudget survey, 64% of adults said they end up spending more money when they shop with friends.


This makes me curious about social retail, so I built an app that can be added to e-commerce sites to test social retail behavior:

[Browse Party](https://browse-party.herokuapp.com/)

Browse Party is a video chatroom that can be added to any website. After a simple signup, a website owner receives access to a dashboard that includes a code unique to them. This code can then be copy and pasted into their website where they want the Browse Party tool to appear.
