## Organizing Persona and Creating User [Job] Story.

Our persona is Jason, a 26 year old, male, consultant, from London. He makes a "good" salary and his financial level is intermediate. This means "heâ€™s never invested but he understands the basics of things and has been reading Finimize for some time."

I've organized Josan into a User Story using As a..., When..., I Want..., So...
Below is a preview of the story, but click [here](https://airtable.com/shriib91ZPRXZPMLf/tblCpRmyH2pHx5oiI/viwkChBkmkV4NldO1) to view the full document.

## Wireframing

After establishing what Jason's story might look like to track progress towards his goal, I began putting pen to paper. Bellow are a couple of my initial sketches. However, be sure to open the above ðŸ‘† Airtable User Story document to reference the sketches with each story line.

While putting together some ideas, I immediately realized how useful [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) would be for this feature.

I began playing around with the HighCharts API to see if something could be created in line with my initial wireframing. Check out the JsFiddle [here](http://jsfiddle.net/cwgeg9r3/).

## Graphing & Sketch

Once I had an idea of how to layout the UI, I dove into Sketch. The starter template greatly helped to match Finimize's design.

This is where I brought together my wireframes, JsFiddle graph, and Finimize's design to show off a potential full package.

## Discoveries and Alterations

While wireframing, I came to a discovery that allowed me to eliminate a step for the user in the tracking process.

You can see these steps in the "Deprecated" section of my AirTable User Story document.

I first asked the user if they had made any new savings in one modal screen, then asking them to enter the savings amounts in a second screen.

I decided to eliminate the first step and simply have the user click update with pre-filled ï¿¡0 if they have not made any savings.

## Framer Animation

To implement a more attractive input screen, I want to give the user a small feeling of reward for simply inputting a number. I do this by creating a wealth generation feeling in a coin collecting animation.

I created this animation using [Framer](https://framer.com/) connected to Sketch.

## Next Steps

### Feature Role Out

ðŸ”´ Notification on the goal should allow for the majority of feature discovery and interaction. It also might be nice to have an Intercom notification of the visual tracking feature once a user hits the /goals page.

### Adding To The Feature

The current tracking feature doesn't allow a "reminder to save money" button. I like this feature in the /goals page as it allows a user to continue with the product but encourages them to come back at a later date. I would explore adding this to the feature.

This would email the user encouraging them to transfer the money and come to the app to update/review their results.

### User Follow-Up On Feature

Once in the hands of users, these are questions I'd like to see answered:

* When did you notice the feature? What did you think? Did you use it straight away?
* What attracted you to it?
* Were there any barriers to you using it?
* Have you told anyone about it? What did you say?
* What would you change to make this feature more enjoyable to use?
